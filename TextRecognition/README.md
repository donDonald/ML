# Text recognition
Text recognition is very basic ML feature and very actuall.
Applicable for many cases:
 * Scanning documents for translation
 * Scannning prices, tickets
 * Scanning road signs content in Automotive

Here is another sub-set of ML recognition algorithms exists:
 * QR-code scanner
 * BAR-code scanners
